# Turbio river vulnerability figures for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5

This repository contains the figures, source code and animations of the article "Coupled model for assessing the future vulnerability of watersheds to climate change impacts using deterministic model and neural networks". Gnuplot, Julia and R languages were used for plotting the results of simulation.
